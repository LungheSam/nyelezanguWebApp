**Nyele Zangu – Where Beauty Meets Convenience** 💇🏽‍♀️

## 🌟 Project Overview

Nyele Zangu is a digital platform designed to connect clients and trusted salons across Uganda. The web/mobile-ready application lets clients discover salons via location, name or service filters, view ratings & availability, book appointments instantly, and manage bookings — all from their phone or browser. For salon owners, Nyele Zangu provides tools to create a profile, list services & pricing, manage bookings, and reach new clients with a professional online presence.

With Nyele Zangu, beauty becomes simple, accessible, and dependable for everyone.
